What a difference a week can make! I've just completed my first week in London at General Assembly on the Web Development Immersive programme and it's definitely been one to remember. Having moved down with the help of my stepdad a week ago on Saturday, I had roughly two days to settle in to life in London before the hard work actually begun. I opted to not burn out before the course had even started and so spent that time exploring, doing a bit of painting and enjoying the final minutes of actual downtime.

I'll do a brief run through of the weeks events by the day and try to stick to this format for all twelve weeks moving forward.
<h1>Week 1 - Day 1 - Monday</h1>
Arriving at Second Home for 9am, I met the rest of WDI 19 aka 'Electron' (sounds like aÂ Transformer) and given a brief tour of Second Home where GA is based for the Web Dev course in London. Straight away we we're all aware that this was a very cool, unique working environment with lots of interesting tech companies based within the same building and free teas and coffees in the restaurant (who doesn't love free coffee?!).

Our tutor for the course is a guy called Alex and it was also apparent from the beginning that he knew what he was talking about and that he could deliver the course in an interesting and engaging way. I couldn't help but compare this learning environment to university lectures and noticed that unlike uni everyone actually seemed to be very attentive and excited to be here as every single person had put their lives on hold and spent a lot of money to be sitting in a chair at Second Home.

We didn't do much coding as it was the first day of the course, but instead did a huge <strong>installfest</strong> in which everyone put the same bits and bobs onto their laptops so that we were all at the same place. For our day 1 homework we went to the pub to celebrate the start of the 12 week course!

Mood: <strong>Excited</strong>
<h1>Week 1 - Day 2 - Tuesday</h1>
So today the hard work started. We jumped straight into <strong>Git</strong> and <strong>Github</strong>, building an understanding first of the differences. Git is a version control manager that allows the user to save drafts of their work to their local machine in case they ever need to go back in time. Github on the other hand is a social networking platform in which these version control files can be shared and collaborated on.

As the day continued we also looked at <strong>Sublime</strong> text editor and a few shortcuts to help accelerate our coding workflow. The rest of the day was spent having an introduction to <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> in which we studied how they go hand-in-hand as structure and design.

Baring in mind that we had started with HTML 101 at around 12pm, our homework set at 5pm was to build a replicate of the Instagram homepage from a screenshot provided. The whole class went into an after hours classroom as we begun to figure out what to do, with a few mini-meltdowns occurring throughout. The majority of us had finally finished by around 9pm, ouch!

Mood: <strong>Confident</strong>

<h1>Week 1 - Day 3 - Wednesday</h1>
Today was a biggie. After doing a homework review (something that will now be occurring every weekday morning) on the Instagram HTML/CSS challenge, we first had a visit from Cassie (GA's resident outcomes support) who gave us an intro to the job hunting support that General Assembly provides. Although we were very much at the start of the journey it's definitely a massive plus of studying at a place such as GA that they begin to prep their students to think about life beyond the course right from the get-go. For the rest of the morning we examined a few extra bits within CSS that hadn't really been covered. By about 11am we had put that aside and jumped straight into <strong>JavaScript</strong> 101 by looking at different data types. I felt pretty good at this point as did most of the class, as many of us had seen this before in the pre-work, but by the early afternoon we were playing with if/else statements and loops.

Our homework for the night was to create a text-based calculator using JavaScript that would function through alerts on an empty page. The task required no CSS styling but the use of JavaScript loops and if/else statements was essential as the calculator needed to perform a variety of different complex tasks. After feeling pretty positive about yesterdays homework I definitely felt a little battered by this one as my maths skills aren't the strongest and I got a little bit stuck on a few of the formulas e.g. BMI and mortgage. We again left the homework room by around 9pm - I think this is going to be pretty standard!

Mood: <strong>Frustrated</strong>
<h1>Week 1 - Day 4 - Thursday</h1>
I struggled to get up massively this morning, probably due in part to the fact that I've had some messed up working hours over the last few months and aren't used to these 13 hour working days. Several other people in the class were also feeling the strain of the workflow by today. We begun by doing a homework review in which several people got up to show their homework and the code behind it before Alex showed us his solution code which definitely helped a lot.

The day then centred first around understanding <strong>JavaScript</strong> functions as a means of shortening code by storing commands to recall later, understanding global scope vs local function scope and then finally by looking at the <strong>DOM</strong>. Although initially I looked at the board and wondered "who the hell this Dom bloke was", I was pleasantly surprised when I found out that the DOM was a communication method built into the browser that allowed HTML files to be read and understood in a way that JavaScript could manipulate it. In other words we were now looking at how we could take a still website built in HTML &amp; CSS and shake it up a bit by adding some interactivity using JavaScript! I've done a fair few modules online with Treehouse and Codecademy and had always wanted to get to this point, though it never seemed to come.

The homework for the tonight well and truly booted us into the deep end of the pool. We had to take Alex's calculator solution code and build a second calculator, only this time it had to have an interface built using HTML &amp; CSS and manipulated using JavaScript. After a very shaky start for the entire group though we definitely smashed it with a good vibe going around the room as people helped each other work through their problems. We left by around 9:15pm.

Mood: <strong>Powerful</strong>

<h1>Week 1 - Day 5 - Friday!</h1>
Everyone loves Friday. To celebrate surviving our first week of classes we had a team breakfast at Canteen (a weekly occurrence) and started class an hour late at 10am.

The homework review brought up several issues in that lots of people were a little bit unhappy on their understanding of the DOM and all the new interactive JavaScript commands we had just learned (including myself), but by the end of the day much of that was alleviated through lots of practice with Alex in the class. We also had brief sessions on <strong>debugging</strong> and a good talk on <strong>RTFM</strong> (read the f*ing manual) which if nothing else taught me that a Developer spends half of their lifetime Googling problems (and rightly so).

Friday was definitely the most chilled day and by 4pm we were set our homework task. Combining the knowledge we had obtained throughout the week, we needed to build a fully functioning Naughts and Crosses (tic-tac-toe) game constructed in JavaScript and HTML and styled with CSS. The majority of us headed to the pub to destress after already putting in about 50 hours of work so far.

Mood: <strong>Annoyed</strong>
<h1>Week 1 - Weekend - Saturday/Sunday</h1>
After coming in slightly later as it was the weekend and everyone needs a bit of a lie-in, I arrived at Second Home to see that around half of the class had opted to come in and crack their homework together which was good.

It was definitely the most difficult thing we'd done yet, with the biggest challenges being that we not only needed to create functions and loops that would provide the frameworks for the game but we also needed to recall and use the DOM commands that would link this code to our front-end HTML structure. About 8 hours later and many, many long periods of frustration I had a working game! I couldn't resist taking the homework game a step further and so stayed a little later than most to create a random AI move using a function I'd seen in the pre-work so that the computer played against the user. The funny thing is that looking at the game now, if you didn't know how to code you'd probably be very unimpressed by it's basic functionality but the amount of work it takes to get their is almost unbelievable!

The rest of the weekend is going to be spent chilling out but overall it's been a manic and fast paced week but the progress from Monday to now has been phenomenal to see and is probably in part due to the collaboration of everyone on the tasks we're set as a second pair of eyes really do often spot an issue that you could spend an hour not noticing.

Mood: <strong>Confused</strong> and then <strong>Proud</strong>
