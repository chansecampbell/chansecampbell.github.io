Hi there, my names Chanse and I’m from the UK. As a recent graduate from The University of Manchester, the prospect of no more nerve wrecking exams and caffeine-fuelled dissertation benders has been something of a pipe dream to me over the past year or so. Existing somewhere within that temporary bubble of delusional, self-induced ignorance I told myself that all the hard work had paid off and that I was finally “free”.

The only problem however was that the end of my tenancy was fast approaching on my cosy little student flat and I still hadn’t even considered looking at graduate jobs. Not only that but everywhere I went people were beginning to ask me “what now?” and “what have you decided to be?” To be honest the answer has always been and still really is “I don’t know”. Simply put, I still have no more idea today than when I started University in 2010 what I actually want to do with my life.

But I know what intrigues me and so that brings me to this blog. Following a decision to take my future into my own hands, this blog is therefore my documented attempt to explore the world of coding as I attempt to acquire some new skills. My actual degree at university (English Language) is completely unrelated to coding and so this decision is a complete step in a new direction for me moving forward as a graduate, something that excites and completely terrifies me in equal ways. I've had very little experience with coding, having messed around with HTML4 in the early noughties at around 13 years old. I've always been technically minded however, and close friends and family have often asked why I've not taken an interest in computing so as I looked to make a decision coming out of education, the choice seemed to make sense. So with my part time job just about keeping me ticking over and everything I own in this world now crammed into a room comparable to a prison cell back at my parents house in Leeds, I will thus dip a toe into the creative, techy world that I still know so little about.

After some in-depth research that spanned across several days I decided upon my first port of call in my self-taught learning adventure - Treehouse, a website that teaches the basics of coding languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP to the aspiring beginners such as myself. After a cross comparison of the different online services available it felt like the correct choice mainly because of the simplistic, slow paced videos that helpfully explain concepts and the code challenges that attempt to engrain the newly acquired knowledge within your mind.

With a months holiday to Thailand booked and my bags packed I therefore had an initial two weeks in which to try out the service first hand. Unable to wait until my return to start learning I therefore followed the How to Make a Website course within the Web Design Track with Nick Petit. My resulting website, (which can be found at www.chansecampbell.com), was a fantastic thing to see for such a newbie to coding and is something that I hope to build upon as my learning experience continues within the foreseeable future with Treehouse. But for now, it's time for Thailand!
