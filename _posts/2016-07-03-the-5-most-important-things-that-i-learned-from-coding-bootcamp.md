A month ago I finished a <strong>12 week course</strong> at <strong>General Assembly</strong> in London which aims to get you job ready as a Junior Web Developer in only 3 months. I've blogged about my experience along the way, but here are my <strong>5 most important thing's that I've learned</strong>.
<hr>    
<div> <h2>1. You can't compare yourself to others, but it's also impossible not to do it a bit</h2>
      I heard this piece of advice before I'd even started my course and it on the surface it completely makes sense. <em>"Don't compare yourself to other people, everyone joins with a different level of experience"</em>. Whilst I agree that you really can't waste any of your valueable time dwelling on this whilst on the course, the bottom line is that it's human nature to compare yourself to your peers and feel a twang of frustration when it takes you a little longer to solve the problem in a certain homework than your neighbour. The gaps between individuals abilities is especially prevalent within the first month as front-end ground is covered that some have already taught 
      themself but this is just something that you've <strong>got to accept</strong>.

      <h2>2. A good network of people are crucial to your learning progress</h2>
      I think most people (myself included) considered the ability to <strong>focus on coding for 12 weeks</strong> straight without distractions the most appealing thing about studying at a place like GA. However the actual cohort (both your fellow students and instructors) are probably the most <em>valuable resource</em> that you'll have throughout your bootcamp journey. Self teaching yourself to code is <strong>hard</strong> and takes <em>real</em> perserverance and a decent level of Google-foo ninja-like abilities to crack. Having a network of people that are at your level of knowledge is <strong>great</strong> - you have a second pair of eyes for when your stuck and a supportive network of enthusiasts that understand <em>how much</em> those small wins really mean.

      <h2>3. You have to enjoy putting up with hours of frustration for small moments of glory</h2>
      Early on in my course we were tasked with building a JavaScript calculator in one of the first ever evening homeworks. Suddenly there it was, <strong>a red error message</strong>. Panic ensued. I threw my hand in the air and said <em>"it's broken"</em>, <em>"it's not working, I think somethings wrong with <strong>it</strong>"</em>. It doesn't take long before you actually realise that the problem isn't actually the code but <strong>you</strong> instead. The countless hours of my life that I've seemingly had to spend frustrated and confused trying to solve an error basically almost always boil down to human error and my <em>inability</em> to spot or decipher where I've actually gone wrong. Over time if you're going to truly commit to the goal of being a junior developer you've <strong>got to accept</strong> you're mistakes and embrace the debugging. When you start to buzz off of those small, infrequent moments of discovery then you probably know that this decision was the right choice.

      <h2>4. Being a developer is all about becoming comfortable with not knowing things, but knowing how you go about discovering the answer</h2>
      Nobody likes to feel like they aren't in control of things in their life. However, on an intensive coding bootcamp course you're about to have that rug ripped from underneath your feet. The sheer amount of new topics about to be thrown at you is <em>slightly</em> bonkers, but after a couple of weeks of uncertainty you have to adjust to the situation at hand and simply <strong>accept that this is the process</strong>. Unfortunately a developer's life is one that will never be mastered, with languages that we've learned over the last 12 weeks probably being obselete within the next 10 years. Learn to go with it and just give it your all. Although you'll never know everything, you do learn to understand how to <strong>get better at discovering the answers</strong> a little quicker.

      <h2>5. You won't be a superstar after a 12 week course</h2>
      <strong>This</strong>. The expectation you have of yourself coming onto a coding bootcamp <em>probably</em> exceeds the reality of the situation you will find yourself in by the end. <strong>Yes</strong> you will learn a ridiculous amount not only about coding but about yourself. <strong>Yes</strong> you'll learn what it means to work within a developer's working environment with a good network of support. But <strong>no</strong>, you probably won't be able to code your own startup alone or charge a thousand pounds a day as a freelancer after just 12 weeks of learning to code. The road is <em>only just beginning</em> as you finish the course, but you can 100% take comfort in the fact that you've overcome your first hurdle, one that was potentially the <strong>hardest</strong> to leap over. Now you have to go out there and practice, fail and eventually hopefully flourish.
