It's now officially the end of the course at General Assembly in London and this is my final (sort of) weekly recap on learning to code at a bootcamp. The final three weeks at GA were as fast-paced as ever, here's what we got up to.

<h1>Week 10 - Day's 46, 47, 48, 49 &amp; 50</h1>
After recently completing two successive projects in what felt like a very short amount of time, it was nice to <em>finally</em> have a stretch of roughly two weeks in which we were back in 'lesson mode' for the final time on the course.

Week 8 mainly comprised of an introduction to <strong>Angular</strong>, a front-end Javascript framework that allows developers to do lots of cool things without relying on the server side. The magic in Angular seems to happen through it's ability to let developers extend HTML's syntax, allowing us to do some interesting things within the front end that didn't seem too dissimilar to embedded ERB or EJS tags that we had seen earlier on the course. What really made Angular seem <em>more</em> special to me though as the week went on was in it's ability to neatly use templates and Angular terminology that quickly allowed different HTML content to appear or disappear whilst never actually leaving the page. This meant that we were suddenly able to start delivering a <strong>multi-page website</strong> experience in a <strong>quicker</strong> and more <strong>fluid</strong> way than ever before.

As brilliant as this all sounded however, I couldn't help but shake the feeling that although I was really enjoying being back in JavaScript land and liked the idea of Angular - it just <em>wasn't</em> as easy to get working in comparison to <strong>Ruby</strong> (Sinatra or Rails). I think that it absolutely made sense to switch us onto another language and back during the course as it allowed the class to see that <strong>learning a new language isn't as scary as you'd believe</strong>, but the issue really boils down to the fact that Ruby (especially using Rails) just feels <em>so</em> simple to use. Going to Angular after that just felt a little bit like we'd been spoilt for far too long. This weekends homework was to really have a crack at making an Angular website from scratch OR play around with pulling data from an API into the front end and using Angular to manipulate it. I decided to personally have a little play with some API's that might be of interest during my final project in just over a weeks time.

<h1>Week 11 - Day's 51, 52, 53, 54 &amp; 55</h1>
This week was a <em>weird</em> one. In a lot of ways we were all pretty aware now that the end was nigh and so a number of things begun to happen that made Week 11 stand out from other weeks. Firstly we had an increased amount of career panel talks from industry professionals which were as useful as ever in giving the class some insight into what companies are looking for in a Junior Developer. Secondly we also had <em>two</em> group field trips this week (and I was severely disappointed in the lack of school coach to get us there).

The first trip was to Moo, a trendy online printing company that had an <em>incredible</em> new office and nice work ethic. The second was to GDS (Government Digital Services) which definitely had a different vibe and although very informative, probably wasn't for me. It was interesting to hear though how two very different companies utilised their Developers and definitely made us think about the kind of companies we would potentially like to work for when we finish.

Besides from the career orientated trips and talks, we played with several cool bits of technology this week including <strong>Grunt</strong> (stream lining task management and condensed the amount of files linked in projects for more speed), <strong>Jekyll</strong> (make a personal website in a matter of minutes, win!) and also <strong>Sockets</strong> (live interaction with an event taking place across two screens simultaneously.

By the time that Friday came around it was time to run our ideas past our instructor Alex and then crack on with the <em>final project of the course</em>! I'd decided to go a little more simple with my idea than I had initially planned as I was very keen to <strong>practice everything</strong> that I had learned over the past few fast paced weeks. My idea was therefore to make a sort of <strong>travel journal website</strong> where a user could list trips that they have been on and then view a map that updates itself to show how much of the world they have currently traveled (think a digital scratch map). With everybody fuelled up and ready to crack on over the final weekend of the course, our first challenge was the get the <strong>authentication</strong> working on our apps which turned out to be a bigger task than many of us had actually expected.

<h1>Week 12 - Day's 56, 57, 58, 59 &amp; 60</h1>
It was the <strong>final week</strong> and we were now deep in project mode! Although <em>lots</em> of us had problems with the authentication over the weekend, I had finally managed to pretty much get it working by the Monday when I arrived in class. My challenge for the week ahead was the get the models planned within the backend and then link it up to the frontend so that I could get my user plotted map working. Here was my wireframe from the weekend:

<a href="https://thelongcodeahead.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/hello-world-wireframe.png"><img src="https://thelongcodeahead.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/hello-world-wireframe.png?w=300" alt="hello-world-wireframe" width="300" height="177" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-421" /></a>

The first day seemed to be a <em>breeze</em>, but <strong>reality</strong> hit home on Tuesday in true WDI fashion when I spent the <em>majority</em> of the day trying to wrestle with referenced data that existed in Mongo. However Wednesday and Thursday were new days and as the week continued I made some slow but steady progress towards the app that I'd set out to make.

Thursday also came with some <strong>unexpected good news</strong>, myself and another person in the class found out that we were going to be the new TA's on the next course at General Assembly. Although I'd applied earlier in the week, I'd tried to push it out of my mind whilst focusing on my final project. However the prospect of staying at GA for another 3 months to help other people and cement my own knowledge is amazing and was something that I had to follow through with!

The <strong>final day</strong> for our course at GA was definitely a bit of an emotional one. On the one hand, the fifteen of us that had just completed the 12 weeks (along with our TA's and instructor too) were absolutely <em>knackered</em> and the stamina was starting to run out all around. But the on the other we had all grown extremely used to this routine of coming in to Second Home everyday, having <strong>a hundred</strong> new things thrown at us and then coming out the other side a <em>little bit</em> wiser than at the start of the week. Here's my final (incomplete as of yet) project, <strong>Hello World</strong>:

<a href="https://thelongcodeahead.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/hello-world-ss1.png"><img src="https://thelongcodeahead.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/hello-world-ss1.png?w=300" alt="hello-world-ss1" width="300" height="164" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-422" /></a>

There was a few great speeches during our final morning standup followed by some <em>fantastic</em> projects being presented by the rest of the group - and then it was finished, with a glass of champagne in hand. The celebrations that followed took us to the ping pong club Bounce, followed by GA's own Thirst Fridays in Farringdon (and then out until silly o'clock).

<strong>And that was that.</strong>

The last 12 weeks have been an emotional rollercoaster and the sheer amount of knowledge thrown at us day after day has been nothing short of <em>mental</em>. There have been some highs and some lows (often seeming to follow each other in quick succession) but overtime it became fairly rhythmic and we definitely have all finished knowing that there has been so much progress made but equally there is still <strong>so much left to learn</strong>. 

I'm planning to integrate this blog into my new personal website within the next week or so and will probably cease to blog on here from now on, but will probably also leave this content here as an archive. If you'd like to check out my new site, you can find me at <strong><a href="http://www.chanse.co.uk" target="_blank">www.chanse.co.uk</a></strong> (having a wrongly spelt first name comes in handy sometimes).

Until next time though..
