Happy 2016 :) I've officially completed my first year of working full time after graduating from University as I've learned lots of crucial life lessons in the process. I can't explain how excited I am for the things to come this year - beginning with my (re-)enrolment on the WDI course at General Assembly in London beginning March 14th.

I said a couple of months ago that my plan was to get back into coding and finally commit full time and I can now proudly say that I've handed in my notice and will be finishing full time employment at the end of February.

The decision was definitely a scary one, but a welcome one never-the-less. Over the next month I'll be blogging about several coding related things once again before I officially turn this into my Junior Web Developer coding blog in March with weekly updates of my learning journey.

I'm going to follow this post up in just a second with an update on my first ever e-commerce website that I've almost complete but I can't wait for the changes to come in 2016 and my big move to London!
