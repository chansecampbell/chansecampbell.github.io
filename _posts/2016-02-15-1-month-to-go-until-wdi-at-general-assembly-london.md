Today marks the countdown. It's now exactly 4 weeks until I begin on the March 2016 cohort at General Assembly in London. As I've stated in previous posts this has been a long time coming but finally things are starting to become real. Last week we were shared into the necessary pre-work that all WDI students are required to complete prior to the start of our coding journeys next month. As I briefly enrolled last year I was aware of the impending work and so it's definitely been something that I've been anticipating since around Christmas time when I firmly confirmed my place.

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Getting reacquainted with Terminal and Javascript</strong></span>

After receiving the welcome email from Lexie last week I excitedly booted up the work and had a skim through the content we would need to work through on our own. As expected there was a section dedicated to learning to use the Terminal, a powerful application that allows a user that knows what he is doing to navigate their computer and very quickly move, edit and perform all kinds of computer wizardry without the fancy GUI that us everyday users are so used to interacting with. Although I found the exercise a little bit frustrating at first (I sweared to god it would be quicker to just right click and create a new folder rather than failing to figure out how to type the correct commands) I eventually got the hang of things and almost begun to see how powerful of a tool using the Terminal could be after a little more practice.

Along with Terminal there was quite a lot of work around Javascript 101 such as learning what Variables, Loops and Functions are. This is definitely stuff I've had a play with before so it didn't take very long before I found myself getting back into the swing of things but one of the biggest issues I've found at the minute is that every exercise we are required to update our homework but I have little to no way to test it. I suspect it will all make sense when I've completed all 6 chapters and have to go back to fix a couple of bad lines but that's all part of the learning process, right?

<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Slack</strong></span>

One thing I absolutely love is the addition of the group messaging community 'Slack'. Along with the pre-work I was added into this last week and instantly introduced to a community of other WDI beginners and current students who seem to use the platform to work through issues together. This is a really smart idea as already I've confirmed whether or not my homework is on track with where I should be just by searching up a particular module and seeing whats already been discussed. I suspect I'll be back on very soon to try to smooth over my final pre-work WDI fundamentals project.

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">GitHub</span></strong>

The thing tying the entire pre-work project together is GitHub, something I've heard a lot about since I begun to dabble in coding but something I've never actually used until now. If I'm not mistaken, GitHub is an online storage repository for applications built by the coding community. However where GitHub really shines is through it's ability to share the code with the community, meaning any average Joe could in theory 'fork' a copy of the code, take it offline to edit and improve and then 'push' it back to the original copy as a suggested change. Right now I'm doing this with my own updates of the pre-work Javascript project through my terminal (and I'm not 100% sure I'm doing it completely right). I have a feeling that I'm yet to see the full potential of this tool although it may come into full light next month when we begin to work on group projects that require people to work on the same set of code at the same time without mass confusion.

So there we have it, one month to go and lot's of stuff to sink my teeth into! If anyone out there reads this that is considering studying at General Assembly or somewhere similar in the near future then keep tuned for an insight into the learning process and my potential growth over the coming months!
