Over the last few days I've continued to work on the WDI Fundamentals pre-work set by GA in preparation for the course next month. Whilst parts of the Javascript have quickly felt like second nature (variables, if/else statements), a lot of things have surprisingly thrown me off at times as I've continued to work on the final fundamentals project.

As a future student at GA all new WDI students are tasked with ultimately creating a fully functioning game of rock, paper, scissors powered by Javascript by the time we start the course. This has proven to have it's challenges for many people, with countless students asking for help on the various chapters in which we need to add more functionality. I tried to set a personal goal to myself that I would strive to figure out my coding issues for as long as possible with this pre-work but now, finally at chapter 5.5 I'm stuck and the white flag is officially waving.

One thing I've found a little confusing about the task is that we are required to create some functions earlier on in the chapters that then need to be used in conjunction to finally create a function that plays the game with user input vs a random automated computer response. This has proven a little tricky with the terminal spitting back errors such as "no playerMove" and infinite loops from the below code:

I can't wait to look back a few weeks from now and laugh at my simple mistakes but right now these small multi-line errors have caused a few stressful evenings in which I haven't really gotten anywhere!

<strong>Key lesson of the day:</strong>Â If you hit a coding brick wall, ask for help instead of smashing your head against it.
