So it's official. My first attempt at a website, after several drawn out months of learning HTML and CSS with Treehouse was in fact bloody terrible. Don't get me wrong, I didn't for a second think that I could produce anything amazing but I have to admit that I was a little disappointed with the final result. I think the major learnings coming out of this first attempt are as follows:

1. Ecommerce sites (involving the addition of shopping carts and various other plugins) are a terrible, <em>terrible</em> idea for a first website. I only just manage to build a decent fluid homepage that transformed from a mobile to a desktop design using floats to help keep everything moving in the right directions. Being the amateur that I am, I thought that it would be very easy to just implement a shopping cart plugin in by pasting the correct code into my existing markup. Enter a templating language known as 'liquid' and elements of javascript that I'm yet to have attempted and I was left confused and a little lost.

2. It's very important to consider the typical structure and layout of similar websites to the one your building. I found this out after reading a couple of articles and then begun to notice a similar structure for different kinds of websites. My best guess is that it provides the user with a level of familiarity in navigating a webpage. This was also an important part of my learning process as I quickly began to realise that I just didn't have that level of knowledge yet to create an ecommerce page to the standard of some of the online shops I viewed. I decided early on here that I would thus base my design off similiar smaller boutique websites that didn't follow the typical scroll-wheel of large images and drop down shopping menus.

3. Any experience is good experience. Seriously. I may not be happy with my final result but I inevitably learned a damn lot in the process of making this thing over a couple of days. I went back over lots of my notes taken during my learnings at Treehouse and even stole a few of my earlier ideas from my Codepen and combined all that into an attempt at making something completely new and of my own design. And that's all I can really aim to do, try to make things and hopefully learn from my past mistakes moving forward. So I'm planning to take on board things such as the layout issues I had whilst using a float structure to organise my elements and the importance of learning some javascript so I can start adding functions like search bars and shopping carts.

For anyone out there that may also be learning to code like myself, hopefully you'll be learning and making mistakes in a similar way to myself because I have a feeling that it's the only way that we will ever get any better! I'm attaching a screen cap of my first ever website attempt for future reference more than anything. I've not actually done anything with HTML and CSS in over 3 works because I've been away with work (which has put my learning massively behind), but I've just now decided that I'm going to pick up and do a little refresher with General Assembly's Dash course online before finally moving into Javascript!
