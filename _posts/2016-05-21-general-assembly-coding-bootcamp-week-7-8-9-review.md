So I think it's safe to say that I've massively dropped off doing these recaps over the last few weeks, but I think that's had something to do with the fact that between weeks 7-9 we've had two whole projects to do as part of the GA curriculum. It's been a manic past few weeks and it's crazy to think that I'm already now so close to the end of the WDI course. Here's a (brief) recap of weeks 7, 8 and 9!

<h1>Week 7 - Day's 31, 32, 33, 34 &amp; 35</h1>
Week 7 was the week of the second project! Having spent quite a bit of quality time with Ruby and Sinatra over the past couple of weeks, we were tasked with building a multi-page and multi model website using Rails. It was both an exciting and daunting task, as we were also to be without our instructor for the majority of the week before our final presentations as he was away at a General Assembly global conference.

Surprisingly I managed to stay very true to my wire frame designs that I had knocked up over the previous weekend and throughout the week got the chance to try out a few interesting Gems such as commentable, ransack and carrierwave. My project was called <strong>'Skwap'</strong>, a skill swapping website which can be found <a href="http://skwap.herokuapp.com/">HERE</a> and the github including readme <a href="https://github.com/chansecampbell/wdi-project-2">HERE</a>.

Despite a few issues here and there (I tried to be overly ambitious with some tabbed pages that were actually a nightmare to get working) we finished the week and in my opinion absolutely smashed it! We ended up having a celebratory game of beer pong, a meal and night out on the Friday which got very messy. Afterwards I went home for the weekend and it felt lovely to just chill out and do nothing for the first time in over 6 full weeks.

<h1>Week 8 - Day's 36, 37, 38, 39 &amp; 40</h1>
Week 8 was a struggle. We got back to classes and basically did a crash course introduction to APIs in Express. It was so weird transitioning back into Javascript so quickly after our Ruby on Rails project, but at the same time it was impressive that everyone in the class quickly snapped back into a different language. We were introduced to Mongo databases with a little bit of help from Mongoose, and spent much of the week on the 'MEN' stack as we currently hadn't got to the Angular part yet. API's seem very cool and the power that utilising and mashing up different collections of data seems to bring is a very exciting concept. By the Friday we were back into project mode, although admittedly it felt a little bit too soon as we had barely had any time to play with many API's. Our task this time was to work in our assigned groups of 3 to utilise one or more API's and make a website. Without a front-end framework such as Angular present, we instead needed to use Underscore to get our templating done. I would say that this week and the one that followed were definitely the two we're I've felt the most lost as of yet.

Dividing up the workload over the weekend was a slightly odd concept, as we then had to go away and discuss how best to divide the work up between three people. Most of the weekend was spent wireframing, planning and for one member of our group - setting up the initial app and security using OAuth.

<h1>Week 9 - Day's 41, 42, 43, 44 &amp; 45</h1>
Week 9 was the week of the group projects and the API's! Although we all managed to rotate the jobs throughout the week, I would say that I spent the most time with the API this week. We initially intended to use Google Maps and plot onto it Foursquare venues using their API so that users could find the perfect date venue and could have a bit of fun sliding the intentions of the date which would filter out date venues. We ran into some issues however in attaining a developer key from Foursquare, who's developer site seems extremely broken after we tried to access it across multiple devices. We ended up having to compromise with the Google Places API, which wasn't ideal due to a lack of venue information - but onwards and upwards!

Working and coding in a group was interesting but enjoyable. It definitely helped to teach me a few things about compromising and being patient in terms of the different ways in which people work. I also realised that working in a group seems to mean that you do end up working a little bit more slowly. We had a few group git merge nightmares where people pushed the same files which resulted in conflicts (which sounded much more scary before it had actually happened) but all was fine for the most part in terms of Git. By the end of the week we had produced a site that utilised the Google maps api and plotted potential date venues that were scale able by fancyness on a on screen slider. It was pretty basic, but fantastic to see what we could do with data and an interactive map and has definitely got me thinking about what we could do next. The site is called <strong>'Pear'</strong> and can be found <a href="https://pearapp.herokuapp.com/">HERE</a>, or on Github HERE although the images need fixing at the moment as we've had some issues putting it onto Heroku.

Friday also came with a nice surprise, no homework for the weekend! The end of our third project essentially meant that we were going into the final 3 week stretch which culminates in a big final project. Where has the time actually gone? This weekend was all about resting up because I knew that if the final quarter of the course would be anything like the first 9 weeks, it would be a sprint for the finish line.
