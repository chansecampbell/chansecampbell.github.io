Merry belated Christmas! So it's been a while since my last post and I've been busy and not-so-busy doing loads of different things. In my last update I talked about being accepted onto the March 2015 WDI course at General Assembly. I'm now a month and a half away from starting my 12 week course and still very excited about the lifestyle change as the start gets ever-closer.

After a manic December in which I was sometimes working two jobs in one day things have really settled down and I've now finally had a little bit more time to focus on my independent learning once again. I started off at the start of January by going through the basics of the WDI pre-course work by rereading over front-end content, mainly HTML and CSS. It was a nice little refresher in all fairness and I'm planning to put it into use in a week or so by finally updating my website that is still currently displaying the content made in Nick Pettit's "How to make a website" video I did months ago.

Along with my front-end rehash sessions I've also recently upgraded my Macbook Pro (late 2011) with a 256gb SSD and 16GB of ram. Now I know that it was a slight overkill but I have to say that I absolutely love the results of seeing a machine on it's last legs suddenly rise from the dead! My thinking behind the upgrade was that my Macbook was realistically not running at the speed required for WDI and it was either buy a new machine or fix the one I had. My spending basically ends there though because it was recently my 23rd birthday (I swear they are getting less exciting every year now) and I've basically just stored the money I got straight into a savings account for my move to London because I have a feeling I'll be needing every penny I can scrape together! With my new found power-machine I decided to have some fun with Photoshop CS6 for the first time in yearrrrsss and thanks to some great tutorial videos,  as per usual from Treehouse, I've actually started to crack the basics of using Photoshop. It's going to be nice to combine these skills at a later date as I've currently been using Photoshop to improve my mum's online business on a small scale.

Next up I'm finally going to be tackling some Ruby as part of my WDI pre-work and will update on the learning curve as and when I get to it :)
