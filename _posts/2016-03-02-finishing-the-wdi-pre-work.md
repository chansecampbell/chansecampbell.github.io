As I type this I've literally just submitted my final pre-work to General Assembly for it's marking prior to me starting the WDI course in under two weeks time. There were definitely some highs and some lows during the work, in particular a few checkerboard exercises during the Arrays chapters that had me stumped for much longer than I would like to admit, but ultimately I made it through with a little help from Slack and my fellow GA students!

As I said in my previous post, it is actually pretty endearing to see other coding newbies that have just cracked a certain chapter suddenly turning around and helping the next person through their coding woes. I'm hoping this is a taste of things to come as ultimately the success is that much sweeter when it's figured out instead of just being handed to you on a .txt platter by the teacher.

The project that we were working on throughout the pre-work was a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors running in Javascript. For testing purposes we were to use repl.it to run the code and interact with it from within a terminal environment. Very quickly it became a great tool to check if our coding was off and to easily share it with others for feedback. I previously posted a piece of the code that I was having trouble with, but in the end I got my game to successfully request user input at the start before finally revealing on the terminal the player vs computer moves and an overall winner. Happy days!

Although this game works, the biggest thing I would be keen to change in the future is the fact that currently the loops continuously requests input (up to around 10 times) before displaying any of the computer moves you can see on the right hand side of the screen. It would be really nice if every input then displayed who won that round throughout, rather than showing me everything at the end. But at least it works for now.

The final thing we had to do on this pre-work was commit the edits and then push the file back to our GitHub repository so that it's viewable online. One thing that I found unclear here (and noticed that others did too) was that I was initially attempting to push the file I'd been working on rockpaperscissors.js rather than the entire wdi-fundamentals-rps folder which was required in the end. After figuring that out though my changes have been made viewable <a href="https://github.com/chansecampbell/wdi-fundamentals-rps" target="_blank">via this link here!</a>

Overall the pre-work has been a challenge having to work alone, but Slack has alleviated some of those self-learning issues. I have a feeling that the hard work has nowhere near begun but I'm now eagerly awaiting day one in 12 days time!

<strong>Key Lesson of the day: </strong>When using GitHub, push the entire branched folder back instead of just the file you've been working on.

<strong>Tl;dr </strong>Finished my GA pre-work after a few speed bumps. 12 days to go until the web development immersive begins!
