As I've begun to now experiment with different ways in which to learn with HTML and CSS I've found that applying concepts and theories learnt within Codepen invaluable. I've not made anything worth shouting about, but being able to translate my notes into direct results is immensely rewarding and something I feel I can build upon and notice progression with. Because of it's usefulness thus far I'm now going to soon go back and build things with previous lessons as a bit of a refresher.

I'm nearing the end of my basic CSS learning with Treehouse and I have to say I've moved much slower than I anticipated due to real life commitments. It's slightly laughable that I thought I would have clocked the Web Designer track by now when I'm still on CSS Foundations! I've begun to realise though that I'm not aiming for speed but for understanding. The plan is to finish up on CSS, go back and build more on Codepen and then hopefully create a mock up website design from everything I've learned this far.

I feel that as I'm now working on transitions and transforms within CSS that I've finally reached "the good stuff", something that also feels incredibly rewarding as being able to create moving elements that roll across the page is very exciting, considering the fact that a month ago I didn't really understand anything about CSS values and selectors.Â I still need to brush up on my selectors as they still confuse me and I feel that my code if fairly messy, but I'm hoping this a common newbie mistake and I'll be able to become more efficient with my selectors over time rather than fall into bad habits.
