Another week has <em>already</em> been and gone! I can't believe how quickly it's flying by here in London but we are definitely learning a hell of a lot in a very short amount of time. Here's my run through of week <strong>3</strong>/12 on the <strong>web development immersive</strong> course at <strong>General Assembly</strong> in London!

<h1>Week 3 - Day 11 - Monday</h1>
Projects galore! We worked through the bank holiday in what felt like a super long weekend whilst everyone around us seemed to be living it up and getting drunk. Sunday ended up being a bit shitty with me coding for hours only to realise by about 7pm that I really was not getting <strong>anywhere</strong> with the problems I was trying to solve. Luckily Monday was a <em>much</em> more productive day. We were basically left to our own devices to finish off our projects functionality wise, which I managed to do with a bit of help from of the the TA's Ollie who helped me create the structure needed for my multiple levels on my game (which I decided to call <strong>Blipper</strong>). As it turned out, I just needed to create an object that would contain all my key parts such as player location, computer location, exit location and obstacles and I ended up being able to loop through these as each level was completed.

In the afternoon we were advised to start "styling the <strong>shit</strong> out of it" by Alex so we all cracked on with making it look nice. I'm pretty happy with the final product, I'll post it on tomorrows piece after a few more adjustments. Tomorrow I'm going to be presenting it back to the group, so I'll talk more about the good and bad bits of the game then. I left at around 8:30pm.

Mood: <strong>Focused</strong>

<h1>Week 3 - Day 12 - Tuesday</h1>
It's presentation day! We spent the majority of the morning finishing off our games, mainly by styling them, fixing glitches and then finally by making sure we pushed them to their Heroku link so that they were actually viewable online. I can now officially show mine. Bare in mind that you need to keep your expectations low as this is the fruits of my labour after only learning to code at GA <em>two weeks</em>(!!!!) ago (although I've messed around in the front end a little in the past). My game was based on <strong>Hitman Go</strong>, a cool little strategy game on mobile made by Square Enix. I initially wanted to go for an 8bit feel but ended up giving the game a sleek, material design finish. <strong><a href="https://github.com/chansecampbell/wdi-project-1" target="_blank">Here's the Github page</a></strong> for anyone interested in actually understanding the game, and <strong><a href="http://blippergame.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">heres the link to play it</a></strong>!

I'm pretty proud of the end product and can already see the ways in which I could improve the game after the course has finished. Currently it only works on desktops/laptops and it definitely has <strong>responsive scaling issues</strong> on bigger screens, but I think I'll definitely revisit <strong>Blipper</strong> to make it function better when WDI comes to an end and I actually have the time.

It was <em>really</em> interesting to see what everyone else had done for their projects as we had all kind of been in our own worlds and had only seen fleeting glimpses of everyone else's code over the past few days. The most fascinating thing to me was seeing how much <strong>variation</strong> there was in the games produced from the <strong>same brief</strong> - from Space Invaders to Connect Four, Mastermind to Flappy Birds. Our final topic of the day was to hit the pub as we were given the amazing news that we had no homework for once. This was the general reaction from most of the class:

Finished at 5pm. I could get used to this.

Mood: <strong>Chilled</strong>.

<h1>Week 3 - Day 13 - Wednesday</h1>
Let's be honest, the good times were never going to last very long were they. Wednesday meant the start of lessons once again, something that were were all excited to do but today was <em>definitely</em> a struggle. I think it was a combination of a lack of sleep, feeling slightly ill, not having had a lesson for 6 days and also having a slight hangover but today was definitely the biggest struggle yet concentration wise. 

We started off with a discussion into <strong>'the history of the internet'</strong>, which was a very interesting and insightful look at how the net has developed and grown over the years. My favourite part was the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_Room_coffee_pot" target="_blank">trojan coffee pot</a></strong> story, to which our tutor Alex referenced as being one of "the most underrated internet innovations of the 90s". As the story goes, a couple of people at Cambridge essentially invented the idea of a webcam just to solve the issue of having to walk to the coffee pot in the other room only to find that it was often empty. The webcam they created allowed them to watch the coffee pot, saving them pointless trips and making sure they could always get the coffee when it was fresh. That's <em>pretty</em> fucking boss to be fair.

Next we had an <strong>outcomes</strong> meeting that discussed pitching and how to sell ourselves, very interesting stuff. We then got back to the nitty gritty stuff and it was time for something new - <strong>Node</strong>. Now I'm not going to lie, it's been a very long day and I'm currently bloody knackered so I think I need a bit of time to reread over some notes to fully grasp my understanding of today's concepts. But from what I can remember, <strong>Node.js</strong> was created 7 years ago and allows <strong>JavaScript</strong> (predominantly a front-end client side language) to work like a <strong>back end language</strong> used for servers - meaning that once upon a time, someone who was limited to being a front-end Javascript developer could suddenly have all of the power of the back end whilst being able to keep writing in exactly the same language when Node arrived. Now this is pretty cool, and we really begun to see the power of Node during the labs where we go it (along with NPM) to allow us to replicate a server on our own devices, meaning we could run our files locally like a real, live website.

Related to this our homework for the night was to use <strong>Node</strong> to build <em>another calculator</em>..

<a href="https://thelongcodeahead.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/facepalm.gif" rel="attachment wp-att-305"><img src="https://thelongcodeahead.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/facepalm.gif" alt="facepalm" width="480" height="270" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-305" /></a>

This time however we would need Node to <strong>replicate a server</strong> - allowing us to link together different html pages by providing a router with URL links and using POST to push a calculations answer to a second page. To those people out there that have never done this it probably sounds unbelievably straightforward (you're just going from page 1 to page 2 right?), but it was a bit of a head fuck. This was the <em>second</em> homework (with the first being the Twitter stream one from last week) where we all left the class at 5pm with our homework brief and just looked at each other in sheer confusion.

However in the end we all pulled together and managed to tackle the issue with surprising ease, meaning that we finished at a decent time (leaving at around 8:20pm after a bit of styling relaxation time). Even so, I'm not 100% confident that I could replicate what I did today and there are <strong>FAR</strong> too many names/concepts/frameworks/libraries floating around my head right now like Node, jQuery, Json, NPM, Morgan, EPJ.... <strong>It's time for bed</strong>.

Mood: <strong>Lost</strong>.

<h1>Week 3 - Day 14 - Thursday</h1>
Today we had a homework review of the Node calculator from the day before. It definitely felt like we had begun a new chapter of the the course now, looking at how javascript could be used as a server side language to control things in the back end rather than just making things look nice and manipulating them client side. I can also sense that this transition from thinking client side to server side will also be useful seeing as we are beginning a completely new language as of Monday.

After the review had another morning on <strong>Node</strong> and by the afternoon had begun to explore the <strong>7 Restful Actions</strong> of <strong>routing</strong>. From what I can currently understand, REST is a rule or pattern for defining and referencing resources in a <strong>consistent</strong> way across websites. My own issue today is that we are learning so much so fast that it's hard enough to keep up with what's going on, let alone reflect upon whether or not I actually understand the concepts or not. But one thing we are definitely all learning is that on <strong>WDI</strong> you don't <em>really</em> question whether or not your doing good or bad, you just roll with it and everything eventually seems to fall into place through sheer determination and repetition. Control freaks need <strong>not</strong> apply!

The homework tonight was to create a multi-page quotes website that utilises <strong>REST</strong> to add and view quotes at a bare minimum. I decided to go the extra mile and set up the ability to also edit and delete items (all things that I took for granted until I realised how they were actually done from scratch). It wasn't too bad, although admittedly I did have quite a few peaks at the work from throughout the day. Does that count as cheating or is it just refreshing my memory? Who knows. Meh. Finished today about 9pm after some <strong>CSS and chill time</strong>. It's funny but the CSS time at the end of a homework has started to become our classes go-to chill out hour at <strong>GA</strong>.

Mood: <strong>Dizzy</strong>.

<h1>Week 3 - Day 15 - Friday</h1>
I can't believe it's <em>already</em> the end of another week at GA! This ones <strong>definitely</strong> been the fastest yet. So today we had a team breakfast at Canteen as usual, followed by a homework review of the Quotes homework. We then immediately began looking at tidying up our code by organising it into digestable chunks known as <strong>partials</strong>, with the idea being that we split more of our JavaScript and HTML content up into organised folders in a neat and orderly way. I can definitely see the purpose in doing so as eventually your code stored within different documents almost becomes like a virtual filing cabinet that is quickly accessible down the left hand side, but currently this is pretty confusing as we've suddenly gone from using three files for everything (HTML, CSS &amp; JS) to about 8-12 for a single homework.

In the middle of the lesson our internet went down at <strong>Second Home</strong> for a short while so our instructor Alex thought he'd have a little fun with the class, giving us an <strong>offline code challenge</strong> that rumour has it Apple used to also do (although admittedly in a slightly more complex way). Our task was to build the American flag using only HTML and CSS and with <strong>no internet allowed</strong> (which was good because we had none). I decided to push myself by using no reference whatsoever and this was the result:

<a href="https://thelongcodeahead.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/usaflag.png" rel="attachment wp-att-312"><img src="https://thelongcodeahead.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/usaflag.png?w=300" alt="usaflag" width="300" height="210" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-312" /></a>

It's not the best thing I've ever made and I definitely copped out a little with the stars (they still count though, right?!) but I'm pretty happy with the offline creation overall, especially since I managed it in around 20-30 minutes.

We got back to the lessons and also learned a few interesting things about <strong>Mathias Buus</strong> and some of the cool stuff he's done with Node. My favourite one definitely has to be <strong>Peerflix</strong> which allows for video and audio magnet streaming via peer to peer sharing. It's a really cool idea because unlike normal downloads coming from one file on a server in a certain location, Peerflix allows a user to collect pieces of the jigsaw from the other people using the file (meaning the more that use it, the better the quality of the content becomes as there are more people to pass the chunks of the files around faster).

Friday's are notoriously more chilled out and so we finished for around 5pm. Our weekends homework was to build a <strong>multi-page website</strong> of our own choosing using REST as a structure, and we needed to make it look as genuine and believable a site as possible. But for now that was put out of everyones heads as it was graduation day for WDI 17 (including our TA Caroline) so we headed over to grab a few beers at the Big Chill (a pub close by Second Home) before then walking to Farringdon for the graduation/piss up at around 8pm. There were a few speeches followed by many beers being consumed. I'm pretty sure I was even in the middle of a circle at one point during the night pulling out a few awkward moves like this:

<a href="https://thelongcodeahead.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/partydance.gif" rel="attachment wp-att-314"><img src="https://thelongcodeahead.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/partydance.gif?w=300" alt="partydance" width="300" height="159" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-314" /></a>

I got in tonight at around 2am.

Mood: <strong>Drunk</strong>.

<h1>Week 3 - Weekend - Sat &amp; Sun</h1>
Saturday I was <strong>very</strong> hungover. I tested out my newly acquired knowledge of Peerflix and <em>still</em> hadn't cracked on with the homework by midday. Eventually I sat down at home and &gt;built the basic website structure from scratch, being careful not to forget to install any crucial packages from the NPM that were needed on top of <strong>Express</strong>. By the end of the evening I had the bare bones of my website done and felt very tired and groggy.

And finally today, Sunday, I hit the gym for only the second time since coming to London! I'm going to try and make more effort to exercise as it really does help me wake up and feel focused for the day, but it's just the struggle of keeping motivated when we have so much to do. I spent the afternoon over at Second Home for the first time ever on a Sunday with several of the other guys from the course and by the end of the day (around 6pm) I had managed to make myself a fake website that I was pretty <strong>proud</strong> of.

The site was built as a bit of fun, and is essentially a social media photo sharing platform for Animals (imagine a knock-off animal version of Instagram). Here are a few screenshots:

<a href="https://thelongcodeahead.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/paws5.png" rel="attachment wp-att-318"><img src="https://thelongcodeahead.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/paws5.png?w=300" alt="paws5" width="300" height="165" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-318" /></a>

So just to recap, week 3 has been eventful - although it's felt like an extremely short week! Our first project is officially done (and I have <strong>Blipper</strong> to show for it), and we've now begun to move on to look at server side languages starting with using <strong>JavaScript in Node</strong>. In the space of 24 hours I went from feeling chilled and happy with a project to panicky and lost yet again and I don't expect that those feelings will stop there. Tomorrow we are officially starting a new language, <strong>Ruby</strong> so I'm prepared for anything.

The bottom line is that learning new shit is <em>scary</em> and I think instinctively we all want to be in control of our situation, but the beauty of GA seems to be that it's not only teaching us all how to be decent <strong>junior developers</strong> - it's <em>also</em> teaching us how to be patient and <strong>adaptive</strong> human beings in the process. Ruby tomorrow then? <strong>Not a problem.</strong>
