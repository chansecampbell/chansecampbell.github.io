It's official. A year and a day ago today I actually first started to code with the help of Treehouse after arriving back from my month long holiday in Thailand. It's kind of bizarre to think how much has changed in some ways and in others how very little. For example, in just a short few months I'd taught myself how to fully create a beautiful looking fake website purely out of HTML and CSS, helping me to feel that I was definitely on my way to cracking front end web development. Shortly afterwards I'd begun to look at both Javascript &amp; Ruby on Rails and I'd found that my interest in coding had begun to go to the next level.
<br>
Spurred along by this blog in which I documented my successes and learning curves I felt that I was apart of an elite club of people that understood how to build on a platform that is now so very important in every walk of life. Slightly frustrated by the slow paced nature of self-teaching myself (this definitely does not fit my learning style when coupled with a demanding job) I actually decided to apply for a coding bootcamp based in London and make the big move. Excited was an understatement as the pre-work and countdown begun to my new journey to become a web developer in our capital city.
<br>
However something got in the way, a job offer from my place of work that presented an amazing opportunity of travel, money and a crazy level of responsibility for someone aged only 23. In the end I decided to postpone my learning and follow the career opportunity as I was fully aware that after not doing as well as expected at University this was an opportunity that could never have been overlooked. After 6 months of my first full time job I can now look back on the whole year and reflect upon the decisions I've made and the decisions I'm still about to make.
<br>
Having a full time job in technology training and marketing has been such a great learning curve, helping me to acquire some essential new skills in which to operate within a professional environment that I just didn't have some 6 months ago. Not only that but the networking opportunities alongside some absolute tech giants has been incredible and definitely something that I will long remember and be thankful for. Now as I'm a year on from the beginning of my coding journey and not as far forward as I'd of hoped I'm realising some key things:
<br>
1. If you enjoy doing something and see yourself doing it as a career then you will naturally be drawn back towards it no matter your decisions
<br>
2. If you are drawn back towards said thing, don't ignore the telltale signs and follow your heart as soon as your able to.
<br>
3. Coding is a up-hill challenge and something that requires months &amp; years of practice and a genuine interest in making things that will exist in the world
<br>
4. I believe the above three points to be true and so my decision is ultimately already been made that I'll be looking at finally attending a coding bootcamp and putting this career changing journey into it's second gear towards the end of this year.
<br>
I think the bottom line is that I'm not where I thought I would be a year on from when I wrote my first line of code, and that's OK. Decisions are there to be made and I made mine at the time of the job offer. I learned a lot, and still am. And ultimately I'll be very grateful for the extra grains of wisdom come the time that I finally buckle down and make the career swap that's been over a year in the making. This is still just the start.
