  <h2>About</h2>
</section>

<section>
  <p>Originating from the North of England, I'm a Junior Developer with a keen interest in understanding how to make things work. I've spent the last few years creating training content and delivering it as part of an experiential marketing campaign for a large tech company.</p>

<p>Now I've decided to rechallenge myself by trying my hand at coding, with a desire to create some amazing things. Having just finished three months of training at General Assembly, I'm currently staying on as the Teaching Assistant for the next cohort of students whilst still looking for opportunities to contribute and gain some valuable experience within the industry.</p>
